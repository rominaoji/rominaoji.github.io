About Me
======
I am Romina Oji, a dedicated researcher at Link√∂ping University, specializing in Natural Language Processing (NLP). My current research is focused on Work Package 4 (WP4) of the TrustLLM project, a European initiative aimed at developing trustworthy, multilingual large language models (LLMs) for Germanic languages.

I received an M.Sc. degree from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en), where I was a member of the Natural Language Processing Laboratory [(NLP)](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/web/nlp/nlp), supervised by [Prof. Heshaam Faili](https://scholar.google.se/citations?user=m5tCFEoAAAAJ&hl=en). My thesis was detecting and correcting non-word and real-word errors.

Also, I finished my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering at the Department of Computer Engineering, [Dr. Shariaty University](https://www.shariaty.ac.ir/en), in July 2018. I grasped the basic concepts of Computer Engineering by taking many optional courses on math and computer science, leading to my attaining top grades and my becoming the second top student with a CGPA of 3.87/4.

Feel free to connect with me to discuss potential collaborations and research opportunities or just to share insights on the latest advancements in AI and NLP.
