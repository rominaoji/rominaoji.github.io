excerpt: 'This paper is a Persian language pre-processing tool that has two separate parts: general normalization and text-to-speech normalization.
In general part, there are several normalization functions that can be used regardless of the domain of the task.
In text to speech part, each text is converted to how it is read. For example, the date 1996/10/01 is written the tenth of January nineteen nighty six.'
